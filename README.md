# bonsai-linux-environment-template

This repo is an updated version of the Bonsai.EnvironmentTemplate package which will allow automatic creation of bonsai environments in a linux OS. It adds an activation and deactivation script which places a convenient alias to bonsai in the command prompt when activated and is modelled after the python venv manager.
